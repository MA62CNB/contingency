Contingency

Somewhere in Anatolia, 1910s.
A child leaves alone far away from safe zone and the family too. When the child embarks the journey also it is a chance for army to transmit secret message to headquarter undetected.
When the adventureous reunion journey becomes the only hope for victory in battleground, the kid needs more than a luck.
You as a player have different options. Your decisions make it difficult or easy.
Remember you have couple of skills to overcome the challanges that you face.
Now one player is facing an unknown threat.
Enemy forces somehow learnt your plan and assigned a private to prevent your mission to be successful.
Make the right choices and reach war-free-zone before enemy agents transmit "top secret" intel to the HQ.
Player number two must be ready to act as the latest incoming intel.
Enemy line is planing something, and it might change the course of the war.
Thus, you have to transmit this important message to your HQ to inform them and take required actions.

Each player rolls a die and bigger roll starts the game.

Number One
-You can hide behind a carriage(first junction, translucent path) but there is a risk to be spotted at enemy checkpoint.
Keep rolling 4 or greater in this path to go stealth. Otherwise back to junction and choose wisely! (Persuation)
-You have also longcut(second junction, translucent path) to choose.
It may be more safe and you avoid enemy wild animals but takes longer time! (Patience)

Number Two
-You need to be super quick and a little bit lucky.
Odd number rolls does not let you carry on so event die rolls are what you need.
When you come to junction you may enter local village and take risk of being spotted(try to avoid even number rolls to pass undetected) and turn back to junction or take the longcut(blue path) and avoid all the dangers (Nobody loves foreign forces in mother soil!).
